Turbocharging doesn't only increase power generation, it also enhances fuel efficiency delivering a 34mpg hwy fuel consumption rating that is unsurpassed. The available Chevrolet MyLink Radio connects your compatible smartphone to the MyLink 7inch color touch-screen display and enables you to use screen, voice commands, or the steering wheel-mounted controls. The system also allows you to access apps like Stitcher SmartRadio and TuneIn that can stream over 70,000 radio stations from around the world and best enjoyed with the available seven-speaker Bose premium sound system that features its own amplifier.

With the choice of a sedan or hatchback, it’s time to conquer the world. Sonic is sort of like a magician’s hat; you can fit in more than you’d think. The Sonic hatchback and sedan both offer a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. Which means you can create a setup that works for you. You and your phone are pretty much joined at the hip. Now you can strengthen your connection with Apple CarPlay compatibility. You can use your iPhone to make calls, listen to music, get directions and more on the 7-inch diagonal display. Or if Android Auto compatibility is more your style you can connect your compatible smartphone to access select apps, your calendar and playlists or navigate with Google Maps. Sonic offers available built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi, allowing you and your friends to connect up to seven devices and get a reliable connection up to 50 feet from the vehicle while it’s on. Sonic has your back when it comes to safety by providing many standard features like 10 standard air bags. If you want to feel more secure there’s an available Driver Confidence Package that includes Lane Departure Warning, Forward Collision Alert and Rear Park Assist. The base models are powered by a 1.8L engine but there is also an available 1.4L turbocharged engine and available 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission to give you the perfect combination of efficiency and power.",

The all-new standard 1.4L turbo engine offers a balance of efficiency and power offering up to 153hp and up to 40 MPG HWY. This compact car offers a host of premium comforts – like available leather appointed heated front and rear seats, and an available heated steering wheel. You can also expect a quiet ride with the acoustical laminated windshield that’s specially designed to help keep your drive as peaceful as possible. The Cruze has plenty of ways to stay entertained including standard Chevrolet MyLink with a 7-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The Cruze also offers support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This intuitive technology lets you interact with your maps, your texts, your music and more using voice commands or the MyLink touch-screen display in your car. Access to OnStar 4G LTE and the available built-in Wi-Fi hotspot means the days of searching for a Wi-Fi connection are over. Available wireless charging helps keep your gadgets powered up and ready to go and the available Bose premium 9-speaker system surrounds you with lush sound. Available Rear Cross Traffic Alert uses radar sensors to monitor traffic behind and to the sides of you, and visually warns you of those vehicles using the standard rear vision camera. Available Lane Keep Assist uses sensors to warn you if you unintentionally drift from your lane and gently helps you steer the vehicle back into the lane.",

      "description": "The redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Equinox is a perfect combination of style and versatility with the space to meet your demands. The restyled front end catches your eye with its chrome-accented dual-port grille, while new halogen projector-beam headlamps and available LED daytime running lamps add illuminating detail. For a refined, polished finish the rear reveals bright accents and sculpted taillamps. New 18-inch custom-styled aluminum wheels are standard on LTZ models while 17-inch is the standard on other models. The premium cloth seats on the L, LS and LT models provide a superb level of comfort while the available Saddle Up interior color on the LTZ amplifies the design. Transform your Equinox into an everyday space solver. The Multi-Flex sliding rear seat slides back to add almost 8 inches of rear leg room, slides forward for more cargo room, or folds down to create 63.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Convenient 60/40 split-folding seats provide additional cargo-carrying flexibility. The Equinox is powered by a 2.4L engine that gets an EPA-estimated 32 MPG HWY rating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and an Eco Mode feature to maximize efficiency. The available 301hp 3.6L V6 will allow you to tow up to 3,500 lbs. and comes with an optional AWD drivetrain. Available tech features allow you to make phone calls, compose texts, and even play your favorite songs all through voice activated commands or the 7-inch color touch-screen display. OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi will allow you to connect up to seven devices†, giving direct access to streaming content, music, entertainment and more. Stay safe with features such as the standard rear vision camera, available side blind zone alert, and available rear cross traffic alert.",

      "description": "Whether it’s technology you crave, efficiency you need, or thoughtful details you appreciate, you’ll find everything in the all-new Cruze. The new design features aerodynamic sculpting for a noticeably sportier appearance, and the available projector-beam headlamps with signature LED daytime running lamps leave a lasting impression. The all-new standard 1.4L turbo engine offers a balance of efficiency and power offering up to 153hp and up to 40 MPG HWY. This compact car offers a host of premium comforts – like available leather appointed heated front and rear seats, and an available heated steering wheel. You can also expect a quiet ride with the acoustical laminated windshield that’s specially designed to help keep your drive as peaceful as possible. The Cruze has plenty of ways to stay entertained including standard Chevrolet MyLink with a 7-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The Cruze also offers support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This intuitive technology lets you interact with your maps, your texts, your music and more using voice commands or the MyLink touch-screen display in your car. Access to OnStar 4G LTE and the available built-in Wi-Fi hotspot means the days of searching for a Wi-Fi connection are over. Available wireless charging helps keep your gadgets powered up and ready to go and the available Bose premium 9-speaker system surrounds you with lush sound. Available Rear Cross Traffic Alert uses radar sensors to monitor traffic behind and to the sides of you, and visually warns you of those vehicles using the standard rear vision camera. Available Lane Keep Assist uses sensors to warn you if you unintentionally drift from your lane and gently helps you steer the vehicle back into the lane.",

For a refined, polished finish the rear reveals bright accents and sculpted taillamps.

The Multi-Flex sliding rear seat slides back to add almost 8 inches of rear leg room, slides forward for more cargo room, or folds down to create 63.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Convenient 60/40 split-folding seats provide additional cargo-carrying flexibility. The Equinox is powered by a 2.4L engine that gets an EPA-estimated 32 MPG HWY rating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and an Eco Mode feature to maximize efficiency. The available 301hp 3.6L V6 will allow you to tow up to 3,500 lbs. and comes with an optional AWD drivetrain. Available tech features allow you to make phone calls, compose texts, and even play your favorite songs all through voice activated commands or the 7-inch color touch-screen display.

      "description": "The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

With an elevated view of the road, you can take command of your city's streets. And with the signature Chevrolet dual-port grille, swept-back headlights and available chrome accents, the Trax small SUV is sure to turn heads wherever you go. The interior can be easily reconfigured to maximize versatility, thanks to the 60/40 flip-and-fold rear seat and fold-flat front passenger seat. The fun begins at every stoplight, thanks to the confident acceleration of the 1.4L turbocharged ECOTEC engine that's standard in every Trax. The horsepower is 138, but it's the 148 lb.-ft of at-the-ready torque that makes Trax so responsive to every touch Trax gives you two ways of engaging more directly in your driving, with a standard six-speed manual transmission on LS models, and a six-speed automatic transmission on LT and LTZ models. Turbocharging doesn't only increase power generation, it also enhances fuel efficiency delivering a 34mpg hwy fuel consumption rating that is unsurpassed. The available Chevrolet MyLink Radio connects your compatible smartphone to the MyLink 7inch color touch-screen display and enables you to use screen, voice commands, or the steering wheel-mounted controls. The system also allows you to access apps like Stitcher SmartRadio and TuneIn that can stream over 70,000 radio stations from around the world and best enjoyed with the available seven-speaker Bose premium sound system that features its own amplifier. The available OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi offers great signal quality and bandwidth for up to 7 devices.",

It's like Buick knew exactly what you were missing in a crossover, and created the versatile Encore for you. It's sculpted, elegant, nimble, efficient and luxurious, all at the same time. Encore will turn heads with its chrome waterfall grille, chrome accents, portholes, and tri-shield emblem. Jewel-like translucent projector-beam headlamps contribute to the beautiful and elegant exterior. 18 inch chrome wheels optional and 18 inch aluminum wheels come standard. Your entertainment and navigation choices are simple, purposeful and empowering—the way personal luxury should be. The Buick IntelliLink system will leave you speechless—the instant you talk to it. It's a voice-activated, high-definition system that connects your smartphone, your Pandora and SiriusXM stations, and Stitcher SmartRadio, all through one 7-inch full-color screen. Now available is the OnStar 4G LTE connection which can turn the Encore into a WiFi hotspot. At the heart of Encore's power is a 1.4L turbocharged engine with variable valve timing. For even more peace of mind, the all-wheel drive option seamlessly shifts power to Encore's rear wheels when more is required for better traction and handling. Designing a luxury crossover with you in mind means that Buick started with safety, and Encore takes safety to a whole new level with 10 air bags standard and available features such as Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and all-wheel drive. These technologies combined with great Buick standards like StabiliTrak and OnStar, give Encore a comprehensive safety story.",

The restyled front end catches your eye with its chrome-accented dual-port grille, while new halogen projector-beam headlamps and available LED daytime running lamps add illuminating detail. For a refined, polished finish the rear reveals bright accents and sculpted taillamps. New 18-inch custom-styled aluminum wheels are standard on LTZ models while 17-inch is the standard on other models. The premium cloth seats on the L, LS and LT models provide a superb level of comfort while the available Saddle Up interior color on the LTZ amplifies the design. Transform your Equinox into an everyday space solver. The Multi-Flex sliding rear seat slides back to add almost 8 inches of rear leg room, slides forward for more cargo room, or folds down to create 63.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Convenient 60/40 split-folding seats provide additional cargo-carrying flexibility. The Equinox is powered by a 2.4L engine that gets an EPA-estimated 32 MPG HWY rating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and an Eco Mode feature to maximize efficiency. The available 301hp 3.6L V6 will allow you to tow up to 3,500 lbs. and comes with an optional AWD drivetrain. Available tech features allow you to make phone calls, compose texts, and even play your favorite songs all through voice activated commands or the 7-inch color touch-screen display. OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi will allow you to connect up to seven devices†, giving direct access to streaming content, music, entertainment and more. Stay safe with features such as the standard rear vision camera, available side blind zone alert, and available rear cross traffic alert.",

      "description": "Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. Traverse comes available with RemoteLink Key Fob Services, a component of the OnStar RemoteLink app that gives you access to features such as remote start as well as locking and unlocking, even when miles away from your vehicle. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. If you need a vehicle that can hold up to eight passengers, tow 5,200 pounds and offer better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride than a traditional SUV, the Traverse is the crossover for you.",

It's like Buick knew exactly what you were missing in a crossover, and created the versatile Encore for you. It's sculpted, elegant, nimble, efficient and luxurious, all at the same time. Encore will turn heads with its chrome waterfall grille, chrome accents, portholes, and tri-shield emblem. Jewel-like translucent projector-beam headlamps contribute to the beautiful and elegant exterior. 18 inch chrome wheels optional and 18 inch aluminum wheels come standard. Your entertainment and navigation choices are simple, purposeful and empowering—the way personal luxury should be. The Buick IntelliLink system will leave you speechless—the instant you talk to it. It's a voice-activated, high-definition system that connects your smartphone, your Pandora and SiriusXM stations, and Stitcher SmartRadio, all through one 7-inch full-color screen. Now available is the OnStar 4G LTE connection which can turn the Encore into a WiFi hotspot. At the heart of Encore's power is a 1.4L turbocharged engine with variable valve timing. For even more peace of mind, the all-wheel drive option seamlessly shifts power to Encore's rear wheels when more is required for better traction and handling. Designing a luxury crossover with you in mind means that Buick started with safety, and Encore takes safety to a whole new level with 10 air bags standard and available features such as Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and all-wheel drive. These technologies combined with great Buick standards like StabiliTrak and OnStar, give Encore a comprehensive safety story.",

      "description": "The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs.

      "description": "The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system.

The restyled front end catches your eye with its chrome-accented dual-port grille, while new halogen projector-beam headlamps and available LED daytime running lamps add illuminating detail. For a refined, polished finish the rear reveals bright accents and sculpted taillamps. New 18-inch custom-styled aluminum wheels are standard on LTZ models while 17-inch is the standard on other models. The premium cloth seats on the L, LS and LT models provide a superb level of comfort while the available Saddle Up interior color on the LTZ amplifies the design. Transform your Equinox into an everyday space solver. The Multi-Flex sliding rear seat slides back to add almost 8 inches of rear leg room, slides forward for more cargo room, or folds down to create 63.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Convenient 60/40 split-folding seats provide additional cargo-carrying flexibility. The Equinox is powered by a 2.4L engine that gets an EPA-estimated 32 MPG HWY rating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and an Eco Mode feature to maximize efficiency. The available 301hp 3.6L V6 will allow you to tow up to 3,500 lbs. and comes with an optional AWD drivetrain. Available tech features allow you to make phone calls, compose texts, and even play your favorite songs all through voice activated commands or the 7-inch color touch-screen display. OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi will allow you to connect up to seven devices†, giving direct access to streaming content, music, entertainment and more.

The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the 2WD SL and extended cab base Canyon trim levels, and an automatic transmission is standard on all other models. Canyon's cabin is precisely crafted, exceptionally quiet and comfortable, and designed to the highest standards. The craftsmanship, attention to details and premium materials are what you expect from all GMC vehicles. Canyon features inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. The Canyon was designed to be efficient and maneuverable, yet make a powerful and lasting first impression. Manage your cargo and protect your truck bed with the largest cargo box in a midsized pickup, integrated CornerStep rear bumper for easy access to the box, and available EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate. OnStar offers available 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi hotspot so you stay connected to the internet and your favorite apps anywhere you go.

Chevrolet modernized its big van with rounded corners, high-mounted taillights and stylish truck-like wheels. Chevrolet designed the Express Van with the sole purpose of moving big loads, be they passengers or cargo. Dressed for passenger service, the Express Van crushes the largest of SUVs, providing seating for up to 15 people. In the Express Cargo Van, the Regular Wheelbase 1500, 2500 and 3500 models have 270.4 cubic feet of cargo space. However, if that is not enough, get the Extended Wheelbase 2500 or 3500 models, which have an incredible 313.9 cubic feet of room. It also can be outfitted as a rolling workstation. Knowing that no matter what the mission, the Express Van will need to be prepared, Chevrolet gave its van a beefed-up suspension, available extended-length cabs, a choice of gasoline or diesel engines and even optional all-wheel drive (AWD) in the 1500. All Express Cargo and Passenger Vans are equipped with stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. In the Express Cutaway 3500 and 4500 models, you will be getting a solid foundation for the finished vehicle your upfitter will complete for you. The Express Cutaway can be upfitted to become various vehicles like a school bus, shuttle bus, ambulance, service vehicle and more. It also gives you the choice between gas and diesel engines, and has anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags. Come check out the 2015 Express Van or Cutaway that meets your needs today!",

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue.

Chevrolet modernized its big van with rounded corners, high-mounted taillights and stylish truck-like wheels. Chevrolet designed the Express Van with the sole purpose of moving big loads, be they passengers or cargo. Dressed for passenger service, the Express Van crushes the largest of SUVs, providing seating for up to 15 people. In the Express Cargo Van, the Regular Wheelbase 2500 and 3500 models have 270.4 cubic feet of cargo space. However, if that is not enough, get the Extended Wheelbase 2500 or 3500 models, which have an incredible 313.9 cubic feet of room. It also can be outfitted as a rolling workstation. Knowing that no matter what the mission, the Express Van will need to be prepared, Chevrolet gave its van a beefed-up suspension, available extended-length cabs, and the choice of 2 gasoline engines (a 4.8L V8 or a 6.0 V8) or a 6.6L Turbo Diesel V8. All Express Cargo and Passenger Vans are equipped with stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. The Express Vans also offer available 4G LTE Wi-Fi from Onstar to allow up to 7 devices to connect at once. In the Express Cutaway 3500 and 4500 models, you will be getting a solid foundation for the finished vehicle your upfitter will complete for you. The Express Cutaway can be upfitted to become various vehicles like a school bus, shuttle bus, ambulance, service vehicle and more. It also gives you the choice between gas and diesel engines, and has anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags. Come check out the Express Van or Cutaway that meets your needs today!",

For cargo loading flexibility, swing-out passenger side doors come standard, and on regular wheelbase gas models, a swing–out door for the drivers side is an option as well. The accommodating interior of the Savana Cargo Van is designed to put everything you need within reach. The well-organized instrument panel and driver information center will help you get the job done right. The panel features easy-to-read-gauge clusters including fuel level and maintenance monitors. Plus, available features such as cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel and steering-wheel-mounted audio controls allow you to customize your vehicle. A variety of engines are available per model to suit your needs, be it for personal use or commercial use. Also, depending on the model, you either get a 4 speed automatic or a 6-speed heavy duty automatic transmission. Tow/haul mode provides a dual-mode shift program that lets you hold gears longer, giving you more torque and providing a smooth transition between gears when climbing hills. The StabiliTrak system comes standard and helps keep the vehicle in the direction you are steering it and manages throttle and braking control. Savana Cargo Vans help you get the job done safely. All models feature driver and front-passenger air bags. The standard tire pressure monitoring system uses tiny sensors inside the wheel to broadcast tire pressure to your vehicle, alerting you to their status and Locking Rear Differential can sense a difference in wheel speed between the left and right rear wheels and lock them to turn in unison for added traction.",

On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Of the engine options you have the available Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 with Allison transmission or the gasoline-powered Vortec 6.0L V8 which comes standard on Silverado HD. Its torque curve is broad and flat, with approximately 90 percent of peak torque available at only 2,000 rpm. The Silverado 2500HD is also available with a version of the Vortec engine that allows the use of Compressed Natural Gas. The Silverado 2500HD offers the most standard trailering capacity in its class at 13,000 lbs thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 2500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 17,900 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

      "description": "When it comes to moving payloads, few vehicles are as up to the task like the 2016 Chevrolet Express Cargo Vans, Passenger Vans, and Cutaways are. Chevrolet modernized its big van with rounded corners, high-mounted taillights and stylish truck-like wheels. Chevrolet designed the Express Van with the sole purpose of moving big loads, be they passengers or cargo. Dressed for passenger service, the Express Van crushes the largest of SUVs, providing seating for up to 15 people. In the Express Cargo Van, the Regular Wheelbase 2500 and 3500 models have 270.4 cubic feet of cargo space. However, if that is not enough, get the Extended Wheelbase 2500 or 3500 models, which have an incredible 313.9 cubic feet of room. It also can be outfitted as a rolling workstation. Knowing that no matter what the mission, the Express Van will need to be prepared, Chevrolet gave its van a beefed-up suspension, available extended-length cabs, and the choice of 2 gasoline engines (a 4.8L V8 or a 6.0 V8) or a 6.6L Turbo Diesel V8. All Express Cargo and Passenger Vans are equipped with stability control, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual front airbags. The Express Vans also offer available 4G LTE Wi-Fi from Onstar to allow up to 7 devices to connect at once. In the Express Cutaway 3500 and 4500 models, you will be getting a solid foundation for the finished vehicle your upfitter will complete for you. The Express Cutaway can be upfitted to become various vehicles like a school bus, shuttle bus, ambulance, service vehicle and more. It also gives you the choice between gas and diesel engines, and has anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags. Come check out the Express Van or Cutaway that meets your needs today!",

Of the engine options you have the available Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 with Allison transmission or the gasoline-powered Vortec 6.0L V8 which comes standard on Silverado HD. Its torque curve is broad and flat, with approximately 90 percent of peak torque available at only 2,000 rpm.

The Silverado 3500HD offers up to 14,600 lbs of towing capacity thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 3500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 23,200 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

Under the hood you can choose from the choice of 3 engines including a 2.5L that produces 200hp and 191lb-ft of torque, a 2.8L turbocharged diesel producing a massive 369 lb-ft of torque, or a 3.6L V6 that produces 305hp and 269lb-ft of torque with best-in-class 26 MPG hwy fuel economy. It achieves this by implementing innovative powertrain technologies like Spark Ignition Direct Injection and deceleration fuel cutoff, which shuts off fuel to the engine when braking. With the available trailering package, this small truck is rated to tow up to 7,000 lbs. The Colorado small truck offers a Z71 Off-Road Package with precisely tuned suspension that provides an incredibly stable and comfortable ride for off-road performance. The Z71 package also includes an automatic locking rear differential, which sends power to one of the rear wheels when the other one loses traction to help you stay in control. Colorado was designed to be comfortable in any environment, from city streets to camping retreats. Colorado is the first small truck to combine design features such as inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. Customize your driving experience by arranging the icons and features on the available Chevrolet MyLink 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen.

With a fully charged lithium-ion battery, Volt is capable of driving up to 53 miles without using gas. When the battery runs low on electric charge, Volt seamlessly engages its gas-powered generator to keep you going for a total range of up to 420 miles on a full charge and full tank of gas. With a 240-volt charging station you can recharge in as little as 4.5 hours or 13 hours on a 120-volt charge. The interior provides a refined driving experience, from intuitive driver displays to an available heated steering wheel. The highly crafted interior is thoughtfully designed, down to the blue, jewel-like shift knob and storage to wirelessly charge your mobile device. Volt features dual 8-inch diagonal LED color displays, including a center stack touch-screen display with Chevrolet MyLink. Support for Apple CarPlay allows you to easily interact with some of your iPhone’s features, like music and text messages. The standard OnStar Basic Plan includes select features of the RemoteLink mobile app allowing you to remotely start your vehicle or lock/unlock your doors.

The Terrain’s bold design features a new hood design, redesigned front and rear fascia with chrome accents, new LED daytime running lamps and a new 3-bar grille design that is distinctively GMC. The Terrain's available programmable power liftgate opens to your desired height with the push of a button. Projector beam headlights and fog lamps keep visibility high regardless of weather conditions. Terrain features a long list of features such as premium cloth being standard on SLE models and a new chrome-trimmed gear selector accentuates the interior of all model. A 7-inch diagonal touch-screen is your command center for all entertainment and information. Add in available technologies like navigation, OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi and exceptional safety features and you’ll see why compact Terrain SUV is the total package. A 60/40 split and folding second-row maximizes space allowing for up to 69.3 cu.ft. of cargo space and there is up to 39.9 inches of rear leg room when seats are in the upright position. At the heart of Terrain's performance and power is the 2.4L Engine or opt for the available 3.6L V6 engine. The 6-speed transmission offers a wide ratio spread for power in the low gears and efficiency in the high gears. The Standard rear vision camera displays in the center stack touch-screen, and allows for easy, confidant parallel parking. Finally, the four-wheel independent suspension offers a smooth, steady ride and a precise feel for the road. The available Forward Collision Alert provides an audible and visual signal when a potential collision is detected.",

      "description": "Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. Traverse comes available with RemoteLink Key Fob Services, a component of the OnStar RemoteLink app that gives you access to features such as remote start as well as locking and unlocking, even when miles away from your vehicle. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. If you need a vehicle that can hold up to eight passengers, tow 5,200 pounds and offer better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride than a traditional SUV, the Traverse is the crossover for you.",

The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab.

The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices.

Of the engine options you have the available Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 with Allison transmission or the gasoline-powered Vortec 6.0L V8 which comes standard on Silverado HD. Its torque curve is broad and flat, with approximately 90 percent of peak torque available at only 2,000 rpm. The Silverado 2500HD is also available with a version of the Vortec engine that allows the use of Compressed Natural Gas. The Silverado 2500HD offers the most standard trailering capacity in its class at 13,000 lbs thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 2500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 17,900 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

It achieves this by implementing innovative powertrain technologies like Spark Ignition Direct Injection and deceleration fuel cutoff, which shuts off fuel to the engine when braking. With the available trailering package, this small truck is rated to tow up to 7,000 lbs. The Colorado small truck offers a Z71 Off-Road Package with precisely tuned suspension that provides an incredibly stable and comfortable ride for off-road performance. The Z71 package also includes an automatic locking rear differential, which sends power to one of the rear wheels when the other one loses traction to help you stay in control. Colorado was designed to be comfortable in any environment, from city streets to camping retreats. Colorado is the first small truck to combine design features such as inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. Customize your driving experience by arranging the icons and features on the available Chevrolet MyLink 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen.

Volt provides ideal visibility with gorgeous, aerodynamically integrated LED low beam headlamps and taillamps. With its 1.5L direct-injected, high-efficiency engine, the Chevrolet runs on an electric charge and generates additional electric power through a gas-powered generator when the battery runs out. With a fully charged lithium-ion battery, Volt is capable of driving up to 53 miles without using gas. When the battery runs low on electric charge, Volt seamlessly engages its gas-powered generator to keep you going for a total range of up to 420 miles on a full charge and full tank of gas. With a 240-volt charging station you can recharge in as little as 4.5 hours or 13 hours on a 120-volt charge. The interior provides a refined driving experience, from intuitive driver displays to an available heated steering wheel. The highly crafted interior is thoughtfully designed, down to the blue, jewel-like shift knob and storage to wirelessly charge your mobile device. Volt features dual 8-inch diagonal LED color displays, including a center stack touch-screen display with Chevrolet MyLink. Support for Apple CarPlay allows you to easily interact with some of your iPhone’s features, like music and text messages. The standard OnStar Basic Plan includes select features of the RemoteLink mobile app allowing you to remotely start your vehicle or lock/unlock your doors. Volt also offers available built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi through OnStar for connectivity of up to 7 devices. Available safety features include lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision alert, and low-speed front automatic braking.",

      "description": "Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. Traverse comes available with RemoteLink Key Fob Services, a component of the OnStar RemoteLink app that gives you access to features such as remote start as well as locking and unlocking, even when miles away from your vehicle. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. If you need a vehicle that can hold up to eight passengers, tow 5,200 pounds and offer better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride than a traditional SUV, the Traverse is the crossover for you.",

The 6-speed transmission offers a wide ratio spread for power in the low gears and efficiency in the high gears. The Standard rear vision camera displays in the center stack touch-screen, and allows for easy, confidant parallel parking. Finally, the four-wheel independent suspension offers a smooth, steady ride and a precise feel for the road.

The 2.5L engine is the most powerful in the segment with 200hp. New for 2016 is an available 2.8L turbo diesel engine with 181hp and a massive 369 lb-ft of torque. A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the 2WD SL and extended cab base Canyon trim levels, and an automatic transmission is standard on all other models. Canyon's cabin is precisely crafted, exceptionally quiet and comfortable, and designed to the highest standards. The craftsmanship, attention to details and premium materials are what you expect from all GMC vehicles. Canyon features inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. The Canyon was designed to be efficient and maneuverable, yet make a powerful and lasting first impression. Manage your cargo and protect your truck bed with the largest cargo box in a midsized pickup, integrated CornerStep rear bumper for easy access to the box, and available EZ-Lift and Lower tailgate. OnStar offers available 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi hotspot so you stay connected to the internet and your favorite apps anywhere you go.

The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices.

In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Overprotective? You've met your match in the Enclave. Optional technologies like Side Blind Zone Alert with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning help prevent accidents before they occur. And the industry's first front center air bag is one of seven in total and offers a new level of confidence to safety. Brains or beauty? The Enclave offers both. Buick IntelliLink+ connects you to friends and family hands-free. Stay connected on the road with powerful OnStar 4G LTE. Opt for Bose audio or the rear-seat entertainment system to keep passengers enthralled. And keep out of the cold while your Enclave heats up with remote engine start. Don't let its sleek exterior, generous space and inviting cabin fool you — the Enclave knows how to perform. Its six-speed, 288hp 3.6L V-6 engine is powerful and efficient. Dual-flow dampers in the suspension improve handling and reduce noise and vibration.",

The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines.

In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp.

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Details include a distinct available lighting package with standard projector-beam headlamps and rear LED taillamps, plus a hidden rear wiper system tucked under the rear spoiler at the roofline. Tahoe also offers available power-retractable side assist steps with perimeter lighting. The new Tahoe interior features premium materials that contribute to the functional, sophisticated design. Storage in the center console is large enough to fit a laptop. Plus, the available 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen slides up to reveal space behind the display to store valuables. Customize the touchscreen to choose the information or options you use most and place them on your home screen. Tahoe LTZ models offer standard heated and cooled perforated leather-appointed front bucket seats. You'll enjoy the convenience of available power-release second-row and fold-flat third-row seats, the fastest power-release second-row and power-folding third-row seats of any competitor and the versatility of a flat load floor to store cargo. With the second- and third-row seats folded flat, the all-new Tahoe offers 94.7 cu. ft. of cargo space. It starts with the world-class EcoTec3 5.3L V8, designed to generate more power and offer better fuel economy than any large SUV of any competitor in the industry, an EPA-estimated 23 MPG hwy. The strong, efficient V8 generates 355 hp and 383 lb.-ft. of torque. With a max towing capacity of 8,500 lbs. you'll have plenty of power to tow whatever else you want to bring along.",

The 3500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 23,200 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each.

The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen.

The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

      "description": "Introducing the 2016 Silverado 3500 HD. With new exterior and interior designs, the Silverado 3500HD offers the proven power of Chevy's heavy-duty engines. Of the engine options you have the available Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 with Allison transmission or the gasoline-powered Vortec 6.0L V8 which comes standard on Silverado HD. Its torque curve is broad and flat, with approximately 90 percent of peak torque available at only 2,000 rpm. The Silverado 3500HD is also available with a version of the Vortec engine that allows the use of Compressed Natural Gas. The Silverado 3500HD offers up to 14,600 lbs of towing capacity thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 3500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 23,200 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

      "description": "Whether it’s technology you crave, efficiency you need, or thoughtful details you appreciate, you’ll find everything in the all-new Cruze. The new design features aerodynamic sculpting for a noticeably sportier appearance, and the available projector-beam headlamps with signature LED daytime running lamps leave a lasting impression. The all-new standard 1.4L turbo engine offers a balance of efficiency and power offering up to 153hp and up to 40 MPG HWY. This compact car offers a host of premium comforts – like available leather appointed heated front and rear seats, and an available heated steering wheel. You can also expect a quiet ride with the acoustical laminated windshield that’s specially designed to help keep your drive as peaceful as possible. The Cruze has plenty of ways to stay entertained including standard Chevrolet MyLink with a 7-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The Cruze also offers support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This intuitive technology lets you interact with your maps, your texts, your music and more using voice commands or the MyLink touch-screen display in your car. Access to OnStar 4G LTE and the available built-in Wi-Fi hotspot means the days of searching for a Wi-Fi connection are over. Available wireless charging helps keep your gadgets powered up and ready to go and the available Bose premium 9-speaker system surrounds you with lush sound. Available Rear Cross Traffic Alert uses radar sensors to monitor traffic behind and to the sides of you, and visually warns you of those vehicles using the standard rear vision camera. Available Lane Keep Assist uses sensors to warn you if you unintentionally drift from your lane and gently helps you steer the vehicle back into the lane.",

The new design features aerodynamic sculpting for a noticeably sportier appearance, and the available projector-beam headlamps with signature LED daytime running lamps leave a lasting impression. The all-new standard 1.4L turbo engine offers a balance of efficiency and power offering up to 153hp and up to 40 MPG HWY. This compact car offers a host of premium comforts – like available leather appointed heated front and rear seats, and an available heated steering wheel. You can also expect a quiet ride with the acoustical laminated windshield that’s specially designed to help keep your drive as peaceful as possible. The Cruze has plenty of ways to stay entertained including standard Chevrolet MyLink with a 7-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The Cruze also offers support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This intuitive technology lets you interact with your maps, your texts, your music and more using voice commands or the MyLink touch-screen display in your car. Access to OnStar 4G LTE and the available built-in Wi-Fi hotspot means the days of searching for a Wi-Fi connection are over. Available wireless charging helps keep your gadgets powered up and ready to go and the available Bose premium 9-speaker system surrounds you with lush sound. Available Rear Cross Traffic Alert uses radar sensors to monitor traffic behind and to the sides of you, and visually warns you of those vehicles using the standard rear vision camera. Available Lane Keep Assist uses sensors to warn you if you unintentionally drift from your lane and gently helps you steer the vehicle back into the lane.",

      "description": "Whether it’s technology you crave, efficiency you need, or thoughtful details you appreciate, you’ll find everything in the all-new Cruze. The new design features aerodynamic sculpting for a noticeably sportier appearance, and the available projector-beam headlamps with signature LED daytime running lamps leave a lasting impression. The all-new standard 1.4L turbo engine offers a balance of efficiency and power offering up to 153hp and up to 40 MPG HWY. This compact car offers a host of premium comforts – like available leather appointed heated front and rear seats, and an available heated steering wheel. You can also expect a quiet ride with the acoustical laminated windshield that’s specially designed to help keep your drive as peaceful as possible. The Cruze has plenty of ways to stay entertained including standard Chevrolet MyLink with a 7-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The Cruze also offers support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This intuitive technology lets you interact with your maps, your texts, your music and more using voice commands or the MyLink touch-screen display in your car. Access to OnStar 4G LTE and the available built-in Wi-Fi hotspot means the days of searching for a Wi-Fi connection are over. Available wireless charging helps keep your gadgets powered up and ready to go and the available Bose premium 9-speaker system surrounds you with lush sound. Available Rear Cross Traffic Alert uses radar sensors to monitor traffic behind and to the sides of you, and visually warns you of those vehicles using the standard rear vision camera. Available Lane Keep Assist uses sensors to warn you if you unintentionally drift from your lane and gently helps you steer the vehicle back into the lane.",

      "description": "Introducing the Buick Encore, the luxury crossover with premium materials, ingenious design, flexible storage (up to 48.4 cu. ft.) and purposeful technology. It's like Buick knew exactly what you were missing in a crossover, and created the versatile Encore for you. It's sculpted, elegant, nimble, efficient and luxurious, all at the same time. Encore will turn heads with its chrome waterfall grille, chrome accents, portholes, and tri-shield emblem. Jewel-like translucent projector-beam headlamps contribute to the beautiful and elegant exterior. 18 inch chrome wheels optional and 18 inch aluminum wheels come standard. Your entertainment and navigation choices are simple, purposeful and empowering—the way personal luxury should be. The Buick IntelliLink system will leave you speechless—the instant you talk to it. It's a voice-activated, high-definition system that connects your smartphone, your Pandora and SiriusXM stations, and Stitcher SmartRadio, all through one 7-inch full-color screen. Now available is the OnStar 4G LTE connection which can turn the Encore into a WiFi hotspot. At the heart of Encore's power is a 1.4L turbocharged engine with variable valve timing. For even more peace of mind, the all-wheel drive option seamlessly shifts power to Encore's rear wheels when more is required for better traction and handling. Designing a luxury crossover with you in mind means that Buick started with safety, and Encore takes safety to a whole new level with 10 air bags standard and available features such as Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and all-wheel drive. These technologies combined with great Buick standards like StabiliTrak and OnStar, give Encore a comprehensive safety story.",

The fun begins at every stoplight, thanks to the confident acceleration of the 1.4L turbocharged ECOTEC engine that's standard in every Trax. The horsepower is 138, but it's the 148 lb.-ft of at-the-ready torque that makes Trax so responsive to every touch Trax gives you two ways of engaging more directly in your driving, with a standard six-speed manual transmission on LS models, and a six-speed automatic transmission on LT and LTZ models.

The available Chevrolet MyLink Radio connects your compatible smartphone to the MyLink 7inch color touch-screen display and enables you to use screen, voice commands, or the steering wheel-mounted controls. The system also allows you to access apps like Stitcher SmartRadio and TuneIn that can stream over 70,000 radio stations from around the world and best enjoyed with the available seven-speaker Bose premium sound system that features its own amplifier.

It's like Buick knew exactly what you were missing in a crossover, and created the versatile Encore for you. It's sculpted, elegant, nimble, efficient and luxurious, all at the same time. Encore will turn heads with its chrome waterfall grille, chrome accents, portholes, and tri-shield emblem. Jewel-like translucent projector-beam headlamps contribute to the beautiful and elegant exterior. 18 inch chrome wheels optional and 18 inch aluminum wheels come standard. Your entertainment and navigation choices are simple, purposeful and empowering—the way personal luxury should be. The Buick IntelliLink system will leave you speechless—the instant you talk to it. It's a voice-activated, high-definition system that connects your smartphone, your Pandora and SiriusXM stations, and Stitcher SmartRadio, all through one 7-inch full-color screen. Now available is the OnStar 4G LTE connection which can turn the Encore into a WiFi hotspot. At the heart of Encore's power is a 1.4L turbocharged engine with variable valve timing. For even more peace of mind, the all-wheel drive option seamlessly shifts power to Encore's rear wheels when more is required for better traction and handling. Designing a luxury crossover with you in mind means that Buick started with safety, and Encore takes safety to a whole new level with 10 air bags standard and available features such as Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and all-wheel drive. These technologies combined with great Buick standards like StabiliTrak and OnStar, give Encore a comprehensive safety story.",

      "description": "The Silverado is the truck you know and trust. The modern body is chiseled and sleek at the same time. The dramatic stacked double grille in front is complimented with vertically stacked headlights on either side, outlined in chrome. The bumper is contoured as well. The Silverado currently comes in three models: Short Box Crew Cab, Standard Box Crew Cab, and Standard Box Double Cab. Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

It's like Buick knew exactly what you were missing in a crossover, and created the versatile Encore for you. It's sculpted, elegant, nimble, efficient and luxurious, all at the same time. Encore will turn heads with its chrome waterfall grille, chrome accents, portholes, and tri-shield emblem. Jewel-like translucent projector-beam headlamps contribute to the beautiful and elegant exterior. 18 inch chrome wheels optional and 18 inch aluminum wheels come standard. Your entertainment and navigation choices are simple, purposeful and empowering—the way personal luxury should be. The Buick IntelliLink system will leave you speechless—the instant you talk to it. It's a voice-activated, high-definition system that connects your smartphone, your Pandora and SiriusXM stations, and Stitcher SmartRadio, all through one 7-inch full-color screen. Now available is the OnStar 4G LTE connection which can turn the Encore into a WiFi hotspot. At the heart of Encore's power is a 1.4L turbocharged engine with variable valve timing. For even more peace of mind, the all-wheel drive option seamlessly shifts power to Encore's rear wheels when more is required for better traction and handling. Designing a luxury crossover with you in mind means that Buick started with safety, and Encore takes safety to a whole new level with 10 air bags standard and available features such as Forward Collision Alert, Lane Departure Warning and all-wheel drive. These technologies combined with great Buick standards like StabiliTrak and OnStar, give Encore a comprehensive safety story.",

In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Transform your Equinox into an everyday space solver. The Multi-Flex sliding rear seat slides back to add almost 8 inches of rear leg room, slides forward for more cargo room, or folds down to create 63.7 cubic feet of cargo space. Convenient 60/40 split-folding seats provide additional cargo-carrying flexibility. The Equinox is powered by a 2.4L engine that gets an EPA-estimated 32 MPG HWY rating with a 6-speed automatic transmission and an Eco Mode feature to maximize efficiency. The available 301hp 3.6L V6 will allow you to tow up to 3,500 lbs. and comes with an optional AWD drivetrain. Available tech features allow you to make phone calls, compose texts, and even play your favorite songs all through voice activated commands or the 7-inch color touch-screen display. OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi will allow you to connect up to seven devices†, giving direct access to streaming content, music, entertainment and more. Stay safe with features such as the standard rear vision camera, available side blind zone alert, and available rear cross traffic alert.",

In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp.

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp.

      "description": "Your reign over the road starts the moment you slip behind the wheel of the 2016 Buick Regal. Be treated like royalty with data you rely on front and center thanks to a customizable Driver Information Center. Premium materials keep riding in luxury, even on the longest rides. And racing-inspired accents on the Regal GS prove you don't have to be a royal to know how it feels to be one. Design details like chrome accents and dual stainless-steel exhaust tips add a confident flair, while the newly designed headlamps and tail lamps leave a lasting impression, coming and going. Your wish is the Regal's command, starting with a standard 259-hp turbocharged engine. Regal GS takes the thrill rush one step further with a more hands-on, personalized driving experience. Available All-Wheel Drive offers sure-footed control so you can thoroughly enjoy every twist and turn of the road. New for 2016 is the introduction of Apple CarPlay integration. Available OnStar 4G LTE capability with Wi-Fi hotspot in your Regal helps you stay connected with everything you cherish most. Opt for the available 9 speaker Bose sound system to enjoy higher quality music. With a word, Buick IntelliLink+ connects you to your contacts, MP3s, destinations, and more while passive entry unlocks your Regal without the need for a key — proof that instant gratification isn't limited to the gas pedal. Drive the new Regal and your heightened awareness extends beyond the thrills of the road to its hazards, as well. Innovative, sensor-equipped safety technologies help alert you so you can steer clear of potential collisions and obstacles and navigate every twist and turn with increased peace of mind.",

The Silverado 2500HD is also available with a version of the Vortec engine that allows the use of Compressed Natural Gas. The Silverado 2500HD offers the most standard trailering capacity in its class at 13,000 lbs thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 2500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 17,900 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

The Z71 package also includes an automatic locking rear differential, which sends power to one of the rear wheels when the other one loses traction to help you stay in control. Colorado was designed to be comfortable in any environment, from city streets to camping retreats. Colorado is the first small truck to combine design features such as inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out.

Colorado was designed to be comfortable in any environment, from city streets to camping retreats.

Volt provides ideal visibility with gorgeous, aerodynamically integrated LED low beam headlamps and taillamps. With its 1.5L direct-injected, high-efficiency engine, the Chevrolet runs on an electric charge and generates additional electric power through a gas-powered generator when the battery runs out. With a fully charged lithium-ion battery, Volt is capable of driving up to 53 miles without using gas. When the battery runs low on electric charge, Volt seamlessly engages its gas-powered generator to keep you going for a total range of up to 420 miles on a full charge and full tank of gas. With a 240-volt charging station you can recharge in as little as 4.5 hours or 13 hours on a 120-volt charge. The interior provides a refined driving experience, from intuitive driver displays to an available heated steering wheel. The highly crafted interior is thoughtfully designed, down to the blue, jewel-like shift knob and storage to wirelessly charge your mobile device. Volt features dual 8-inch diagonal LED color displays, including a center stack touch-screen display with Chevrolet MyLink. Support for Apple CarPlay allows you to easily interact with some of your iPhone’s features, like music and text messages. The standard OnStar Basic Plan includes select features of the RemoteLink mobile app allowing you to remotely start your vehicle or lock/unlock your doors. Volt also offers available built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi through OnStar for connectivity of up to 7 devices. Available safety features include lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert, forward collision alert, and low-speed front automatic braking.",

      "description": "Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. Traverse comes available with RemoteLink Key Fob Services, a component of the OnStar RemoteLink app that gives you access to features such as remote start as well as locking and unlocking, even when miles away from your vehicle. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. If you need a vehicle that can hold up to eight passengers, tow 5,200 pounds and offer better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride than a traditional SUV, the Traverse is the crossover for you.",

The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever.

      "description": "Offering the roominess of a traditional SUV but with car-like handling and better fuel economy, there's a lot to like about the Chevrolet Traverse. The Traverse can seat up to eight, drinks less gasoline than a traditional SUV, and starts at an appetizing price. Traverse comes available with RemoteLink Key Fob Services, a component of the OnStar RemoteLink app that gives you access to features such as remote start as well as locking and unlocking, even when miles away from your vehicle. Plus, forward-collision alert and lane-departure warning are added to its roster of safety features. The Traverse also features the MyLink infotainment system and the industry's first front-center airbag. The Traverse comes with a 3.6-Liter V6 Engine with 281 to 288 Horsepower depending on the trim you get. In terms of fuel economy, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive get almost the same gas mileage. However, FWD is the best performer getting an EPA estimated 17 MPG City and 24 MPG Highway. Its smooth and strong V6 easily shuffles this vehicle up to speed, whether in front- or all-wheel-drive form. At 205 inches in length, the Traverse is larger than its direct competitors but doesn't feel bloated on the road. The Traverse offers a comfortable and commanding ride in which the suspension tames bumps and the tall ride height affords good frontal views. The Traverse has three rows of seats that can be configured for seven or eight passengers. Plus, adults can fit into the third row. Copious cargo space swallows shopping bags, luggage and lumber. If you need a vehicle that can hold up to eight passengers, tow 5,200 pounds and offer better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride than a traditional SUV, the Traverse is the crossover for you.",

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Leather-adorned seating, warm wood tones and brushed chrome accents give a sophisticated polish to the interior. And three rows of first-class seating ensure your passengers are feeling their best. Think a crossover that's spacious on the inside has to look bulky on the outside? Guess again. The 2017 Enclave's sleek and fluid profile belies three generous rows of seating and storage, while design details like chrome accents and blue-accented signature LED lighting elevate its eye-catching exterior. Overprotective? You've met your match in the Enclave. Optional technologies like Side Blind Zone Alert with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Forward Collision Alert and Lane Departure Warning help prevent accidents before they occur. And the industry's first front center air bag is one of seven in total and offers a new level of confidence to safety. Brains or beauty? The Enclave offers both. Buick IntelliLink+ connects you to friends and family hands-free. Stay connected on the road with powerful OnStar 4G LTE. Opt for the 10 speaker Bose audio or the rear-seat entertainment system to keep passengers enthralled. And keep out of the cold while your Enclave heats up with remote engine start. Don't let its sleek exterior, generous space and inviting cabin fool you — the Enclave knows how to perform. Its six-speed, 288hp 3.6L V-6 engine is powerful and efficient. The available All-Wheel Drive system automatically activates when you need it most as it constantly monitors traction of all wheels. Dual-flow dampers in the suspension improve handling and reduce noise and vibration.",

In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille.

It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system.

      "description": "Introducing the 2016 Silverado2500 HD. With new exterior and interior designs, the Silverado 2500HD offers the proven power of Chevy's heavy-duty engines. Of the engine options you have the available Duramax 6.6L Turbo-Diesel V8 with Allison transmission or the gasoline-powered Vortec 6.0L V8 which comes standard on Silverado HD. Its torque curve is broad and flat, with approximately 90 percent of peak torque available at only 2,000 rpm. The Silverado 2500HD is also available with a version of the Vortec engine that allows the use of Compressed Natural Gas. The Silverado 2500HD offers the most standard trailering capacity in its class at 13,000 lbs thanks in part to smart technologies like Trailer Sway Control and an available Trailer Brake Controller. The 2500HD equipped with the available Duramax engine is capable of towing 17,900 lbs. With its all-new interior, Silverado HD makes life onboard easier, especially for a work truck. First, the cabin is quieter, thanks to triple door seals and aerodynamic enhancements to the exterior. An all-new instrument cluster features a six-gauge cluster and integrated center control display. From the contacts and music playlists you've got stored in your smartphone, to a selection of on-screen apps like Pandora, to the available MyLink with Navigation, the available 8-inch screen provides instant access to the information and entertainment you want. Managing cargo is now easier as well with a bed built from steel that's roll formed, not simply stamped. Silverado HD's new available load-bearing upper hooks are rated to help secure 250 pounds each. Silverado HD's available EZ-Lift and Lower Tailgate takes hardly any effort to raise and is designed to lower gradually when opening.",

      "description": "The GMC Sierra 1500 possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs. The available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Available 4G W-Fi also helps you stay connected on the go. Sierra 1500 comes with a choice of 3 powerful engines, a 4.3L V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285hp, a 5.3L V8 with 355hp, and a 6.2L V8 with 420hp. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes and having towing capacities from 5,800-12,000lbs.",

Each has six trims with the 1WT as the Base and the LTZ Z71 as the top-of-the-line option. Knowing that it's what's under the hood that counts, the Silverado is stacked with impressive engines. The 1WT, 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 come standard with the 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, with 6-speed automatic transmission featuring best in class torque of 305 lb/ft. The LTZ and LTZ Z71 come standard with the 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, which is also an option for the other trims and features best in class fuel economy. Don't forget the 6.2 EcoTec V8 with 420hp. The Max Trailering Package, offered with both V8 engines, offers class-leading trailering capacity of up to 12,000 pounds. The ride is quiet and the interior more comfortable than ever. The center controls have been updated with an improved layout and are easy to reach. Chevy's MyLink system is an extremely intuitive and helpful system to use. It allows you to control your music, make calls, and navigate to a number of stored destinations all by using your voice. 2WT, LT, and LT Z71 trims get a 4.2-inch color screen to go with it, and the LTZ and LTZ Z71 get an 8-inch color screen. Silverado is also the first full-size pickup to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi for connection of up to 7 devices. In terms of safety all models come with 4-wheel ABS disc brakes with Duralife rotors, StabiliTrak with Electronic Sway Control and Hill Start Assist.",

      "description": "Whether you're headed for a weekend at the lake or a quick stop at the office the 2016 Tahoe gives you the confidence to go anywhere. The striking design of Tahoe features sculpted bodyside panels and an athletic stance. Details include a distinct available lighting package with standard projector-beam headlamps and rear LED taillamps, plus a hidden rear wiper system tucked under the rear spoiler at the roofline. Tahoe also offers available power-retractable side assist steps with perimeter lighting. The new Tahoe interior features premium materials that contribute to the functional, sophisticated design. Storage in the center console is large enough to fit a laptop. Plus, the available 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen slides up to reveal space behind the display to store valuables. Customize the touchscreen to choose the information or options you use most and place them on your home screen. Tahoe LTZ models offer standard heated and cooled perforated leather-appointed front bucket seats. You'll enjoy the convenience of available power-release second-row and fold-flat third-row seats, the fastest power-release second-row and power-folding third-row seats of any competitor and the versatility of a flat load floor to store cargo. With the second- and third-row seats folded flat, the all-new Tahoe offers 94.7 cu. ft. of cargo space. It starts with the world-class EcoTec3 5.3L V8, designed to generate more power and offer better fuel economy than any large SUV of any competitor in the industry, an EPA-estimated 23 MPG hwy. The strong, efficient V8 generates 355 hp and 383 lb.-ft. of torque. With a max towing capacity of 8,500 lbs. you'll have plenty of power to tow whatever else you want to bring along.",
